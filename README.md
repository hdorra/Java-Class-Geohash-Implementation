# Java Geohash Implementation
This is a class which provides an implementation of GeoHashes, completed as part of graduate coursework.

***Overview:***
What is a Geohash? </br>
It is essentially an encoded string derived from a set of latitude and longitude coordinates. It subdivides space into buckets on a grid, which has benefits by reducing 2 coordinates into a alphanumeric string. Each additional character adds precision to the location. Using a string as opposed to a 2D long/lat pair would be beneficial for plotting at different resolutions as well as searching geographical points based on a defined arbitrary precision.</br>

The topics that are covered in this assignment include:

  1. Recursion
  2. Use of Java system libraries
  3. Java arrays
  4. Implementation of an algorithm from a spec
